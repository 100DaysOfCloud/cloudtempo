## Solution _tl;dr_

If you are using AWS Amplify and you are getting an error like this:

```bash
Unable to resolve "./aws-exports" from "App.js"
# or
Cannot find file './aws-exports'.
```

All you need to do is use `@aws-amplify/cli` to pull that file from the cloud, like this:

```bash
amplify env pull --restore
```

Make sure you have:

- `@aws-amplify/cli` installed and configured
- AWS credentials are set up
- You're using the right set of _AWS credentials_ and you're targeting _correct region_ (where the Amplify project is deployed)
- You're importing the `aws-exports` file with the right path (e.g. `App.js`)

Alternatively, you can use `amplify push` but it will also push your local changes to the cloud.

## Explanation

This is a common error when you are using AWS Amplify and you are trying to run your app locally on a new machine. It's a bit misleading because it's not really a problem with the file itself, but rather with the fact that you might be importing a config file that's missing.

Because it is not advised to push this file to the repository (it contains sensitive variables so by default it's listed inside `.gitignore`), you need to pull it from the cloud. You can do it with `amplify env pull --restore` command.

## What is aws-exports.js file?

`aws-exports.js` file This file is generated for JavaScript/TypeScript projects that are using AWS Amplify. It contains the consolidated outputs from all the categories, such as Auth, API, Hosting, etc., and is placed under the `src` directory that the developer specified during the `amplify init` process.
